        <h2>Investing</h2><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-73e16b3b-80ac-6f85-a95e-6ce3c3f342f3"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;color:white"><img class="irc_mi" src="https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ParallelTiredBarasinga-size_restricted.gif" width="250" height="150" alt="Related image" style="margin-top: 0px;"></span></span></div><div><span><span style="background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline;"><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">Investing is a very simple task that anyone can accomplish. We will be focusing on stock investments The basic fundamentals of investing is allocating a small sum of money and devoting it to certain </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">business</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"> or </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">institution</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">. The end goal is to </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">receive</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"> profit in return. In order for the company to return your money, they use the capital you have given them to expand, develop, and invent. Capital is another term for money or loan. With this growth in the company, they are able to make money and turn out a profit. A profit is the surplus of cash made from the </span><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">imbalance</span><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;"> between the amount spent and earned. If the concept is still unclear, I can explain it with a simple analogy. Investing is buying a slice in a pizza. The pizza represents the company or business you have invested in, and the slice represents your share in the institution. Now depending on how much money you have invested, you can get a big slice, small slice, or medium slice. Now you wait, when you're waiting, the pizza can increase or decrease depending on the status of the company. If the company is making money, the size will increase. If the company is losing money, the size will decrease or stay the same. When this happens your slice of the pizza also fluctuates. In the end, you could have a bigger piece than you originally had, a smaller piece, or the same piece. It should be noted that investing is not something that can happen so quickly. It takes patience, dedication, and time. Investing is something everyone should learn about. We invest all </span><span style="font-size: 14pt; white-space: pre-wrap;">throughout our lives such buying a house, buying a car, and planning your retirement. It's good to be prepared when doing these things. </span></font></span></span></div>
        <h2>Stock Market/Exchange</h2><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-9f2cbbfa-80b5-5054-3dc8-7f9ac6b7c8a7"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><br></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;color:white"><img class="irc_mi" src="https://media.giphy.com/media/l0HlDDyxBfSaPpU88/giphy.gif" alt="Related image" width="304" height="171" style="margin-top: 0px;"></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;color:white">A stock market is a place where investors, brokers, traders, and analysts are able to invest, trade or monitor into any corporations or stocks. A stock analyst is someone who analysis the current status of the stock market and reports it to news sources or firms. A stock trader is similar to an investor, only that a stock trader buys and sells shares as a job. Stock traders are people who regularly buy and sell shares in stock in the stock market.  The most famous and by far the most powerful stock exchange is the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City on Wall Street. In fact, there are over 20 stock exchanges/markets worldwide. The main purpose of these stock exchanges is to be a location where investors, traders, and brokers are able to what they need to do. However, in the modern era of the internet, there is no need to physically go to a stock exchange if you want to invest. Now you can simply go to certain websites, that offer the same services as stock markets/exchanges without leaving your home. Thus, this allows anyone to invest and make money. Websites such as E-Trade and Merrill Edge offer these services.</span></p></span></div><h2>Risk</h2><div><span id="docs-internal-guid-b51bbfb3-80bf-0548-8b4f-0e9878595cf1"><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;color:white"><img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/ohdY5OaQmUmVW/giphy.gif" alt="The Hangover Math GIF" style="width: 350px; height: 150px; left: 0px; top: 0px; opacity: 1;"></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1.38;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-variant-numeric: normal; font-variant-east-asian: normal; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;color:white">When investing there is always a risk. Millions of people have lost their life savings from a shabby company. When investing it’s not that you have to work hard, it’s that you to work smart. In investing you are always taking a risk that the company may or may not return money for you. In order to reduce the risk of losing your money to a shabby company, you have to know the company first. To do this you can research basic data about the company. Vital data to know whether or not the company will gain or earn money is earning reports, price trends, corporate decisions, and popularity. You can find all this data online at basic news sources such as CNN Money, The Wall Street Journal, or Yahoo Finance just to name a few. To define some terms, the earning reports of a company is how much money and profit the company has made. If there is large profit that means you will most likely gain money, if there is very little or negative profit then that means you will probably lose or won't make money. Price trends is data that shows increase or decrease in the price of shares in the company. This can help you determine if you want to short or long the stock. Corporate decisions can be found in public news. They state the company's actions such as acquisitions or the releasing of a new product. Knowing corporate decisions can help you determine how well the company is doing in popularity and if the company makes good decisions. Popularity at last means if the general population is interested in the company or if many people have shares of the company. You can determine popularity from corporate decisions and if the company is a popular topic in the media. Popularity can usually signify growth or a possible crash. Overall, these methods are meant to reduce risk, risk can never be eliminated as there is always a chance that something can go wrong. If you are inexperienced in stock or are wanting to test out certain strategies, you can always use a stock simulator. Investopedia provides one that you can use, all you need to do is make a free account. I've used my methods in the simulation and made 4,000 from 10,000 to prove my method is useful. Disclaimer: I cannot ensure that everyone will have the same results and that the method will work for everyone. </span></p><br></span></div><h2>Brokers</h2><div><div><img class="irc_mi" src="https://i.gifer.com/3xuL.gif" alt="Image result for blue valentine gif" width="400" height="200" style="margin-top: 0px;"></div><div><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">If you are perhaps lazy or too busy you could hire a broker. A broker can be a firm, a company that has a bunch of brokers, or an individual who invests in stocks for you. They always charge you for their services and can offer you a variety of options. There are mainly two different types of brokers. First are full-service brokers. These brokers are the most expensive, but they offer you the most options. Full-service brokers are able to offer you trading advice, inform you about what is going on in the market, and carry out investments for you. On the other hand, there are discount brokers. These brokers are awfully cheap but don't offer the services full brokers do. The only service they do offer is executing any trades you would want to make. Overall, brokers are meant for those who are inexperienced or cannot fulfill the trade themselves. Investing is a very easy task and doesn't require brokers if you know what to do. If you would like to hire brokers, firms such as Merrill Edge and TDAmeritrade are online brokering services. </span></font></div></div><h2>Short Stock/Long Stock</h2><div><img class="irc_mi" src="https://78.media.tumblr.com/e3ac4404e1e0d009122c9c7bfc3f730b/tumblr_inline_nwkks7XOUM1s3enod_400.gif" alt="Image result for turtle vs hare gif" width="250" height="150" style="margin-top: 0px;"></div><div><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">In stock trading, there are 2 main strategies one can take. The first is shorting a stock. The second is holding a long stock. Shorting a stock and holding a long stock are 2 opposites as they rely on 2 different strategies. Both methods also have different risk factors. When you short a stock you are borrowing shares of stock from another individual or institution. Let's say that you borrow 100 shares of a particular company. You immediately sell the stock at a certain price. When you short a stock you are anticipating that the price per share will drop. Quickly, the price per share drops. Once the price has dropped, you would buy back 100 shares now at a lower price to repay the lender because you were short 100 shares of the company.  Money is then made from the difference between the original and dropped price. However, shorting a stock is very risky and is only recommended for experienced or skilled traders/investors as they can predict when prices could drop. The reason being that in most institutions/companies, prices usually don't drop but rise/grow and it's hard to predict so. If you were to sell at a particular price, but the price per share rises, you would have to give more money back to the lender. In most instances, it's better to stick with long stocks. </span></font><span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); font-family: Arial; font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">As the name states, l</span><font color="#ffffff" face="Arial"><span style="font-size: 18.6667px; white-space: pre-wrap;">ong stocks are meant for future gains over a long duration of time. With long stocks, you buy shares of a particular company and wait for the company to grow over time. However, you own the shares and therefore can control what you will do with it. In contrast, in a short stock, the borrower doesn't own the shares and has to repay the lender. Like a short stock, you are not guaranteed to make a profit and sometimes can lose money. Long stocks are safer and less risky, because they don't involve debt and you have full control when to sell. </span></font></div><h2>Sources</h2><div><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/">https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/</a></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockmarket.asp</a></p><p><a href="https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp">https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/broker.asp</a></p><p><a href="https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing">https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing</a></p><p><a href="https://us.etrade.com/home">https://us.etrade.com/home</a></p><p><a href="https://www.merrilledge.com">https://www.merrilledge.com</a></p><p><a href="https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page">https://www.tdameritrade.com/home.page</a></p><p><a href="https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/investing-strategies-your-first-stock.aspx">https://www.fool.com/how-to-invest/investing-strategies-your-first-stock.aspx</a></p><p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp">https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp</a></p>
